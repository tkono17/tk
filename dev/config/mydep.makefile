# 1. Define the target executables and libraries
#    There could be as many executables in a project, but only one library
#    is allowed. Both shared library and static libraries could be build
#    for a project. 
#    The executables must have the name XXX.exe, where XXX corresponds to
#    the name of the source file with the main functions.
#    C_EXES for C source files, CPP_EXES for C++ source files and 
#    F_EXES for fortran source files.
# 2. Define how to make all and install, The default is given below
#

# should be set by the command line as "make BUILD_CONFIG='some_value'".
